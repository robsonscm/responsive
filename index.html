                    <span>This is mainly about how to solve technical problems that arise from using front or back end technologies to make web pages or web apps but some of these steps will be applicable to solving technical problems in general.</span>
                </p>
                <p>1. Define the problem that you're trying to solve. If you're not asking exactly the right question then you're not going to get exactly the right answer.</p>
                <p>2. Verify the problem exists. Make sure it's really a problem by replicating the error on more than one machine.</p>
                <p>3. Gather additional information about the problem. Use a javascript debugger, fiddler or any other common tool to get additional clues about the nature of the problem.</p>
                <p>4. Back-up your work before making even a single teeny tiny little change. Don't make things worse when trying to fix the problem. Keep a back-up so you can roll back if you have to.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="col first">
                <h2>In other words you have to sure you're replicating the problem under the right circumstances</h2>
                <p>Sometimes also gathering the information about the circumstances surrounding the problem will help you to redefine the question again. 3. Gather additional information about the problem solve the puzzle</p>
                <p>For instance most browsers log javascript errors so if you're using Chrome you can press Ctrl+Shift+J to bring up the console. Here you might find that your error is related to javascript and Chrome is providing some context on it. Of course if you're error is present only in one browser (everyone please stop staring at Internet Explorer) then you should see what information that browser provides on the error.</p>
                <p>If you need to go deeper into this kind of territory then you should definitely check out Firebug which will make your life a whole lot more pleasant.</p>
                <p>Another good approach to is to validate your html; to make sure you have no fundamental errors and that your DOM is solid.</p>
